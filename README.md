a sport app developed by @flipboxstudio. Preview only.

Folder structure :
+ index.html (the main page of your app)
+ any other assets your app uses - JavaScript or CSS files, images, audio, video and whatnot
+ a config.xml file, based on the W3C widget spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/) , that contains data about your application
+ an app icon image - png files are the widest supported, and your best bet for now


for an example app, please visit : https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-start/tree/master/www
